# Django Archetype

Experimental Django Archetype for web applications. This setup contains the folder structure for a Django project with a PostgreSQL database and a base CI/CD pipeline with test, build, sonar and deploy stages with Docker. The deploy is configured on Heroku. In order to successfully execute this project, you need to set up a sonarcloud account and two Heroku instances (staging and production).
